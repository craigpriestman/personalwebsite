All about me...

[Download my Resume (pdf)]()

UX Designer, researcher, prototyper, consultant and award winner. Based in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Ever since I learnt my strongest asset was emphasising with others, I’ve been a designer inspired to create and develop highly efficient concepts and intuitive experiences and services. Determined and level headed, I aim to apply my understanding and skills which I've gained as UX Designer to deliver well-considered solutions.

EXPERIENCE

Currently situated in Newcastle, I'm a User Experience Designer for [Capita Consulting](https://www.capita.com/expertise/consulting) (previously Orange Bus). My day-to-day activities vary from, formulating project approaches to conducting user and stakeholder research to delivery of interactive products. My core focus is around user experience and interaction design and now I’m expanding my knowledge into service design and strategy.

I have experience leading UX and user research teams on digital transformation projects for start-ups to large organisations. I consult clients on how to improve their service offering, collaborating throughout the research, design and iterative process following an agile methodology.

Before moving back to Newcastle, I worked in London for Bit Zesty – a multi-disciplinary digital innovation agency who work with start-ups, charities, global corporations and government bodies.

As a UX Designer at [Bit Zesty](https://bitzesty.com/), I successfully contributed ideas and created designs for client projects in various business sectors and industries, including GOV.UK, [HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff), [SXT](https://sxt.org.uk/), Trussell Trust and internal digital products throughout the design process, taking projects from early ideation, through to user research, development, prototyping and testing as well as contributing to the improvement of existing online services.

EDUCATION

Before Bit Zesty, I studied 'Design for Industry' at Northumbria University, graduating with First Class Honours. While there, I worked on live projects for Philips, Unilever and Lacoste - and gained industry experience through internships at Coveris Rigid UK and at The Expanded Metal Company.

All of these opportunities and learning experiences continue to provide invaluable insights into various disciplines and industrial practices – I’m always looking to develop and utilise my varied skillset.
