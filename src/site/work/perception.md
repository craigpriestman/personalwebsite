Perception: Empowering the Blind

Final Year Major Project and Exploration Research. Aiming to empower the visually impaired on an everyday basis.

Problem space
Sight-loss affects over 2 million people in the UK on a daily basis. That number is expected to double by 2050 and already many people struggle to cope alone. Technological aids are expensive and awareness is poor for available support. The visually impaired have to adapt and over time create their own solutions to daily living.

Solution
Perception provides an opportunity for the visually impaired to now connect with one another and share these unique ideas. Tablets and other similar technological platforms have empowered the visually impaired with user-friendly Apps replacing many expensive specialist aids. Perception utilises this to offer an App that is an audio-based communication service that creates a highly intuitive and natural user experience.

Perception has an intuitive interface and has been designed in collaboration with the partially sighted.

The App encourages users to share daily experiences, helping others overcome common everyday issues.

More Than Just An App
Perception provides vital information, creates a connected community with external support members and has future potential to expand beyond an interface.

“This is something the RNIB would certainly consider
taking forward. It follows our ethos and would contribute a difference to peoples everyday life. It provides an access point, a portal for people who will struggle to find such valuable information.”
Robin Spinks, Principal Manager, Digital Accessibility, Royal National Institute for the Blind.

My journey creating Perception

What I did
In the beginning, various staged components were carried out to explore potential directions for empowerment.

* Focus groups
* Product evaluations and first-hand reviews
* Charity support
* 'Day in the life'

Insights
Technology has been shown to empower the blind with user- friendly Apps replacing many expensive specialist aids.

* Technology revolution
* Poor awareness of available support
* Younger generation
* Everyday living methods

Discovering Life Hacks
A key insight from initial research came from a focus group discussion around packaging. A visually impaired person shared her method of using elastic bands to differentiate between similar bottles.

Everyday problems each have their own creative solutions.

Opportunity
So, why not create a platform that facilitates the sharing of these ideas and solutions, allowing the visually impaired to build up this database?

Designed With The Blind
Form followed function when designing the App. After an initial framework, focus groups contributed to the refinement of the overall aesthetic of Perception.

Intuitive Interface
Perception embraces audio as a navigation tool. Users can use Voice Over and upload voice memos to forums to create a unique social network.

Product Innovation?
Thought was given to creating low-tech enablers but, it was decided time should be spent on developing the service behind Perception to make the most of this unique opportunity.

Brand development
Creating a positive and distinctive identity to represent the visually impaired.

“This sounds like an excellent idea. It is a concept that blind people will definitely benefit from; I think having a broad range of areas to share will be really beneficial to us. I would be happy to share and I would be interested in finding other solutions too.”
Kimberley Burrows, visually impaired. Young Person’s Campaigner, Envision
