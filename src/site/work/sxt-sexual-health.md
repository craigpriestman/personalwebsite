SXT - Sexual Healthcare

[www.sxt.org.uk](https://sxt.org.uk/)

As a healthcare start-up, SXT aiming to reduce the spread of STIs and raise awareness of local healthcare support.

We were tasked with creating a new look ’n’ feel, re-structuring the user experience and implementating an emergency contraception calculator and booking system.

BACKGROUND
My brief was to re-design the SXT web application to be on-trend, improve user experience regarding a user decision-tree, and instil trust and reliability, despite the sensitive nature of the subject.

The Emergency Contraception Calculator, an element of the decision matrix that allows women to calculate the risk of falling pregnant and find contraception services in their local area, was of particular interest.

The tool requires users to input specific, personal data to calculate the correct health advice and warn of any risks. Ensuring users understood what was being asked and the importance of the resulting health information was crucial to the success of the product.

WHAT I DID
I took an iterative approach, utilizing first-hand research to influence ideas. Taking inspiration from successful healthcare brands and GDS user forms, I was able to create an appropriate brand interface that tied with the medical sector as well as form multiple user journeys, providing users with valuable health advice and contact information.

We tested remotely and with paper prototypes in clinics with patients and clinicians - using their feedback to iterate on visuals and re-write support copy. As the project evolved, I worked on high-fidelty wireframes communicating with a front-end developer the desired output. We rapidly developed a working prototype and tested again.

As the project progressed and further funding was secured from the success of the Emergency Contraception calculator, we added to the service by offering a booking appointment system. The design process followed a similar process, establishing the user needs from members of the public looking for sexual health advice and treatment and the clinic staff members responsible for appointment scheduling.

This time an iterative approach was applied to creating an interactive prototype to test in clinics so we could get feedback on interactions and response rates, before any technical development was required.

IMPACT
The result was a product that allows users to find sexual health information under a minute, within a reassuring and well-considered environment, book an appointment with a healthcare professional and inform any previous sexual partners at risk.
