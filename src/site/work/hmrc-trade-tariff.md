BACKGROUND
HMRC manage the Trade Tariff tool - an online service used extensively by companies who import or export goods. It supplies vital information such as import duty, VAT rates, restrictions, and licenses required for international trade.

The tool needed bringing in-line with new government digital standards and online accessibility requirements.

WHAT I DID
Along with a colleague, we conducted user interviews and workshops with everyday ‘power users’, to understand their needs. We also wanted to discover how we could benefit the wider population - the ‘First Timer’ and ‘Occasional User’, so conducted phone interviews and remote testing with.

Insights such as users overlooking call-to-actions, difficulty understanding technical language, and confusion over which rates and restrictions applied to certain goods, helped form personas which were referred to when ideating.

From post-it note sketches to low-fidelity wireframes, we ideated possible solutions to the numerous issues users and HMRC themselves had raised.

We tested our theories using a hi-fidelity digital prototype with power users and the general public, asking them to complete test case scenarios. After two rounds of iterations, our developments resulted in an increase in task conversion along with a reduction in time taken for task completion.

I contributed to the final report, providing research statistics, visuals and produced a video analysis consisting of key moments from user testing - highlighting the issues we discovered and showcasing the impact of our changes.

IMAPCT
The Trade Tariff now delivers over 2,000,000 page views a month, meets all government digital standards and has improved usability and accessibility.
