I’d personally like to thank Craig who worked tirelessly and patiently with us throughout the engagement to bring the vision to life as a Salesforce experience, his capacity to absorb our feedback, working in a professional manner with clients and extrapolating the key points from our endless debates on the value proposition and convert those into product features was very much appreciated.

Steve Ferguson, Product Owner & Solutions Architect
Synaptic Software, Feb 2020


BACKGROUND

Synaptic Software is a leading provider of products and services to the investment and protection market for over 20 years. With over 50% of financial advisors using Synaptic software, they have a long-established and loyal client base which they are keen to retain and grow.  

Recognising the financial software market is going through a period of change; needs of advisors and clients are changing, and the market is becoming far more competitive with new entrants offering tailored products with a superior look and feel.

Synaptic committed to a programme of work to reimagine their financial planning solution and meet the needs of the market of tomorrow.


WHAT I DID

User research

I lead a Discovery phase to understand Synaptic’s current customers and the potential future opportunities within the financial sector. Working alongside another user researcher and a Business Analyst, I conducted remote and face-to-face interviews and spent time shadowing financials advisors using the existing tool, aiming to understand their pain points and ‘moments that matter’. 

I planned and ran workshops with stakeholders to understand the business’s needs and future intentions, as well as up-skilling others on user-centred design principles and designing with formulated user needs.

As we gathered insights and understood the problems, we visualised them in As-Is service blueprints, incorporating user needs, user journey maps and any current technical architecture. We played back the research findings and visuals to the wider business to get buy-in for change and to educate the client about their customer’s thoughts and frustrations.

Re-designing Synaptic’s service offering

Now having an understanding of the current situation, we collaboratively aimed to reduce the need to use Synaptic’s suite of six products - condensing them into a single, easy to use tool to: 

	* reduce workload duplication,
	* automate the steps in a financial advisor’s day-to-day,
  * help advisors effectively communicate financial advice to their end-client.

Challenging the norm

I hosted daily video calls as the client was based over 300 miles, utilising Miro (formerly known as Realtime board) to map out the new service offering (service blueprints) and visualise the user’s journey (user journey mapping), allowing me to communicate the user’s needs and business’s capabilities to have a meaningful discussion with key stakeholders. A challenge in itself, running remote workshops (before Covid-19) but as the client relationship developed and the team's alignment with Human-centred design the task in hand became easier.

Three days of the week we collaborated online over Microsoft Teams, whilst the remaining two days were spent as ‘production’, time in which I spent sketching paper prototypes, to visualise my understanding of the financial services industry and the opportunities of this new service offering, before producing an interactive prototype.

Platform of choice - Salesforce

To visualise this new service offering and to help the business understand the direction they were going in, I along with another UX designer, created an interactive prototype in Axure. Initially creating wireframes based on the information architecture from our user journeys in Miro, we were continued to develop the designs to reflect our core principles, aligning with user needs, reflecting the needs the such as MiFID II compliance. We knew this would be eventually tested with financial advisors, so the screens were mocked up in high-fidelity and with realistic animation and interactive elements.

The designs also reflected Salesforce, utilising the Salesforce Lightning Design System components. A decision made by the business and technical solution architects team, Salesforce was the platform of choice. As the UX lead, I need to ensure the team were upskilled and aware of the constraints Salesforce applied to our design thinking - a challenge that couldn’t be ignored and we aimed to best utilise Salesforce’s benefits.

Usability testing the new visIon

Following 3 months of concept generation and in-house design work, we needed to get our ideas validated and make sure we had correctly understood the customer's needs and frustrations.

I went on to lead and mentor a new project team, who were stood-up to support and conduct usability testing using the interactive prototype. I overlooked the creation of a research plan and shared best practices for user research and usability testing.

We ran remote testing sessions, using screen share technology to see how a user would interact and navigate the new concept. We interviewed users face to face, asking users to complete tasks in the prototype and to give their feedback so we could continuously improve the designs.

IMPACT
All of the insights and constructive feedback were synthesised and presented back to the client as part of a business-wide show ’n’ tell.  We were able to provide both validations for the concept but also evidence for further investigation into Synaptic’s end-clients. 

Overall, we concluded the phase of work with a summary of changes to be made and recommendations on how best to conduct further user-research. The client themselves had completely taken on-board our user-centred design methodology and looked at changing their ways of working to gets insight directly from users.
