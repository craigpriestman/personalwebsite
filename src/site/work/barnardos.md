BACKGROUND
Barnardo’s provide a broad range of services to people under 25 and for this Discovery phase I was part of the team tasked with researching Barnardo’s various user groups. This included; Adoption & Foster Carers, vulnerable young people, and Young Carers - some of whom were only 12.

WHAT I DID
We conducted workshops, focus groups and interviews (face-to-face & remote). I analysed our research findings, synthesising data into user journeys and personas before proposing solutions, and recommending the direction we take for the upcoming Alpha phase.

The Alpha phase was based on weekly design sprints, each of which focused on a different aspect of the Barnardo’s website and a specific user group.

This intensive and fast-moving approach produced to a large output of work, tested my skill-set and led to various collaborations with external team members, such as content writers and project managers.

I ran ideation and stakeholder workshops, were I presented our discovery findings and nurtured possible design directions. Then I sketched wire-frames and created digital mock-ups in Sketch and Invision, before presenting the refined concept to the client and relative user group. From there we conducted lab user testing sessions and made appropriate design iterations based on our findings.
