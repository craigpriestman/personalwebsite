Taxi Licensing - MHCLG

[Taxi Licensing Discovery blog](https://digital.gateshead.gov.uk/article/11408/Taxi-licensing-fixing-complexity-inefficiency-and-risk)

Gateshead, Northumberland and Sunderland Councils ran a collaborative discovery phase with Orange Bus to explore Taxi Licensing services. The discovery phase was funded by the Local Digital Fund (MHCLG) to understand if there is a need for a digital service, and if so how to move the service forward.

Duration
* 3 months (10-week Discovery)

Role
* Lead User Researcher

Responsibilities
* User Research
* * Interviews (face-to-face)
* Stakeholder Workshops
* Digital Strategy
* Service Design
* * Service Blueprint
* Mentoring
* Agile up-skilling


I just wanted to pass on my thanks to all the team at Orange Bus for the successful completion of the MHCLG funded Taxi Licensing discovery project culminating in a superb show and tell event at Gateshead Council today. Given the fact we only had 10 weeks to deliver this project, the quality of the outputs /deliverables has been first class. Your team are a credit to your organisation and have worked tirelessly and enthusiastically with ourselves and partners throughout this time.

BACKGROUND
Licensing services in local government tend to rely on paper-based application processes and have been slow to adopt digital. This is due in part to internal challenges as licensees often prefer to engage with authorities by traditional means (phone, letter and face to face).

Public safety is also paramount. Authorities need confidence that digital solutions are robust, accessible and effective, also enabling them to share information quickly and easily with bordering councils.

The key challenge for this project was to understand if there was a need and appetite for digital service and, if so, how to move the service forward in a safe and scalable way.

WHAT I DID
I lead and delivered a 10-week agile discovery project. Using multiple research methods to gain a clear picture of the current taxi licensing process, creating a clear blueprint and business case for a set of user-centred service improvements. Activities included:

* Shadowing staff from participating councils see first-hand how taxi licence applications are processed,

* Interviews with taxi operators and drivers to understand their motivators, attitudes and barriers with the process,

* Collaborative design and service scope workshops with the participating councils

IMPACT

This project also stood apart due to its collaborative nature. I hosted regular ‘show and tell’ events ensuring key findings were shared with all parties and enabled everyone to have an immersive learning experience in service design and agile project delivery as they shadowed my research activities or took part in workshops.

This discovery project clearly answered the fundamental question of whether there was a need and appetite for a digitised service. The project not only helped all councils understand opportunities for service improvement within their own services; it also identified the potential for nationwide standardisation across councils.

We identified the need for a more focused follow-on discovery phase, specifically to explore the new driver application process and address the feasibility of digitising the service. Providing this discovery is a success, an alpha phase would then experiment with standardising the service on a small scale.
